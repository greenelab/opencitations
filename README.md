## Environment

This repository uses [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) to manage its environment as specified in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).
Install the environment with:

```sh
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

Then use `source activate opencitations` and `source deactivate` to activate or deactivate the environment.
On windows, use `activate opencitations` and `deactivate` instead.
